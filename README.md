# SubSequences
Simple Sub sequence Merging

I was asked to "Partition" a sequence into subsequences in a recent coding assessment;  I was unfamilar with the terminiology and near the end of my assement's alloted time so I was unable to complete it.  I was intriqued by the question none the less and decided to complete it on my own

This is that solution.
